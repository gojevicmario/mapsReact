# Description
  ```
  Imagine you are a digital nomad traveling around the world with a tight schedule :).
  You would like to take this opportunity and meet up with people leading interesting companies
  that you happen to have a list of.
  Since you like socializing you came up with a great idea that it would be cool to invite people
  from those companies that are near you for a drink so you can all have a nice chat about space,
  time and AI.
  Your task is to create an interactive map based on a CSV file where each row consists of
  location with additional data of interesting companies that will help you to have an overview of
  who you want to invite for a drink.
  ```
# Requirements
  ```
  ● User should be able to input data in CSV format from textarea field or from a file
  ● User should be able to choose which columns represent latitude and longitude
  ● User should be able to choose which column represents label for a label on the map marker
  ● User should be able to show/hide specific rows on map
  ● Input data should be visualized in a table
  ● Each column that represents a link should be clickable
  ● Each column that represents an image link should be rendered inside the table and be
  clickable/viewable
  ● The app should use responsive design and be visually attractive

  Please refer to sample.csv for example of data - feel free to add more rows with interesting
  companies.
